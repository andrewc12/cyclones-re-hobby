Z:\>MOUNT D /MEDIA/CDROM/ -T CDROM
Users of the current version of Ubuntu (9.10 Karmic Koala) may notice that the above command doesn't work. This is because CD-ROMs are mounted based on their label and do not share a common mount point. Open the CD-ROM in Nautilus (or your preferred file manager) to determine its label. Use this command instead, replacing values as appropriate for your system:

Z:\>MOUNT D /media/CD_LABEL/ -t cdrom -usecd 0 -ioctl
Z:\>IMGMOUNT E ~/IMAGES/MYIMAGE.ISO -T ISO



mkdir DOSGAMES

MOUNT C ./DOSGAMES

IMGMOUNT D CYCLONES01.iso -T iso

D:

INSTALL.BAT

EXIT


C:
cd CYCLONE
